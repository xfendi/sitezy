**Sitezy** is a web application designed to simplify website and e-commerce store creation. Its goal is to provide users with an intuitive interface to build professional websites without needing extensive technical knowledge. Sitezy includes a powerful dashboard for managing users, teams, content, and more.

## Project Overview

Sitezy allows users to:
- **Create Websites/Stores**: Choose from a variety of customizable templates to build your site or store.

- **Collaborate in Teams**: Teams can work together on website or store projects, with different permissions and roles assigned to users.
- **Responsive Designs**: Every website created with Sitezy is optimized for all screen sizes.

### Current Development Stage
- **Version**: 0.1 (Beta)
- **Ongoing Development**: The core functionality of website creation is implemented. We're currently expanding the dashboard features and user management capabilities.

### Future Plans

- **SEO Tools**: Help users optimize their websites for search engines with built-in SEO tools.

## Architecture

Sitezy is built using a modern web development stack:

### Frontend
- **React JS**: The user interface is built using React for its reusable components and state management.
- **React Router**: For efficient routing and navigation.
- **Context API**: Manages global state across different parts of the application.
- **CSS Modules / Tailwind**: For modular and scalable styling.

### Backend (To be developed)
- **Node.js / Express**: Planned backend framework for API development and server-side logic.
- **MongoDB / Firebase**: Planned database to store user data, site content, and templates.
- **JWT / OAuth**: Authentication and authorization methods for user accounts.

### API Design
The API will be designed to:
- Handle user authentication and authorization.
- Allow CRUD operations on websites, teams, and content.
- Provide endpoints for third-party integrations (e.g., analytics, payment gateways).
